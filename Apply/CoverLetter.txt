Dear Hiring Manager,
I'm writing to apply for the REACH internship programme because it offers something most internships don't the chance to work on actual projects that matter from the first day.
My background is in programming (Python, C, C++) which has given me strong problem-solving skills and attention to detail. I know this might seem like an unusual fit for an airline, but I think that's exactly why it could work well. I approach challenges systematically, I'm comfortable with technology, and I communicate clearly when explaining complex issues to non-technical people.
What draws me to flydubai specifically is your emphasis on growth and mentorship. I'm not looking for busy work or coffee runs â€“ I want to contribute something meaningful while learning how a successful airline operates. The aviation industry fascinates me, and I'd love to understand it from the inside.
I have a valid UAE residence visa (expires March 2026), I'm completely fine with this being unpaid, and I can commit to the full three months minimum. I speak English and Arabic fluently.
I'm ready to work hard and learn everything I can. I think my technical background combined with genuine enthusiasm would be valuable to your team.
Looking forward to hearing from you.
Best regards,
Moutaz Sami
